# Lokel Job System Collections

## Purpose

These build upon **Unity.Collections** to provide a richer
set of collections. Unity is working on a more elaborate
set of collections but they are in preview.

This package demonstrates how to build upon the limited, existing
set of collections. By being under an open source license, this
can be extended or issues can be easily rectified which is better
than waiting for Unity's new set of collections to come out of
preview, or using them and hoping for the best.

## Features

This package currently provides:

- `NativeQueue<T>`
- `OutValue<T>`

Other collection types may be added over time.

# Using in Your Project

The easiest way to cleanly use this package is via the Unity Package Manager... [follow this link for instructions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)

Alternatively, you may want to download a ZIP from the GitHub
repository and unpack that into your Unity Project. Just make sure you have it in a subfolder of your ***Assets*** folder to avoid
collisions with your own work.
